# A-new-pomodoro-App
I will create a simple web application using python that returns "A pomodoro app" as a response.


I will create a Jenkins pipeline that builds an application, runs tests, and deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster.

To do so I will follow the following steps:

Install and configure Jenkins:
I will install Jenkins and configure it with plugins required for building, testing, and deploying my application.

Set up the Kubernetes cluster:
I will create a Kubernetes cluster.

Set up Jenkins pipeline:
In the Jenkins dashboard, I will click on "New Item" to create a new pipeline. Give a name to the pipeline and select "Pipeline" as the project type. In the pipeline configuration, choose "Pipeline script from SCM" as the definition and choose Git as the SCM.

Configure Jenkinsfile:
I will create a Jenkinsfile at the root of the project's repository. This file will define the steps in the pipeline.

Define stages in Jenkinsfile:
I will define the stages of the pipeline in the Jenkinsfile. Some stages could include building the application, running tests, building a Docker image, pushing the Docker image to a Docker registry, and deploying the application to the Kubernetes cluster.

Use Kubernetes plugin:
I will use the Kubernetes plugin in Jenkins to deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster. The plugin will allow me to define the Kubernetes deployment and service objects in YAML format in the Jenkinsfile.

Run the pipeline:
Once I have defined the stages in the Jenkinsfile, commit the file to the repository, and trigger the pipeline in Jenkins. Jenkins will execute each stage of the pipeline, and I can monitor the progress in the Jenkins dashboard.

I will then have a fully working simple web application that returns "A pomodoro app".
